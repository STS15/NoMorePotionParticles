No Potion Particles in First-Person View Mod
============================================

Overview
--------

This Minecraft mod removes potion effect particles from the first-person view, providing a cleaner and less obstructed gameplay experience. If you've ever been annoyed by the distracting swirls and particles caused by active potion effects while playing in first-person, this mod is the perfect solution.

Features
--------

*   **Removes First-Person Potion Particles:** The mod specifically targets and removes the visual particles that appear when potion effects are active in first-person view, allowing you to focus on the game without visual clutter.
*   **Compatible with NeoForge 1.21:** Built using the NeoForge modding platform, ensuring compatibility with the latest Minecraft versions.

How It Works
------------

This mod uses a Mixin to intercept and modify the rendering process in Minecraft. By targeting the method responsible for displaying potion effect particles in the first-person view, it effectively prevents these particles from being rendered on the screen, without affecting other aspects of gameplay.

Installation
------------

*   Ensure you have NeoForge 1.21 installed in your Minecraft modding environment.
*   Download the mod JAR file and place it in your Minecraft `mods` folder.
*   Launch Minecraft, and enjoy a cleaner first-person view with no potion particles!

Â 

Compatibility
-------------

*   Minecraft 1.21
*   NeoForge 21.0.167+

Notes
-----

*   This mod only affects the first-person view. Potion particles will still be visible in third-person view and for other players in multiplayer.
